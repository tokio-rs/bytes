# TSAN suppressions file for `bytes`

# TSAN does not understand fences and `Arc::drop` is implemented using a fence.
# This causes many false positives.
race:Arc*drop
race:arc*Weak*drop

# `std` mpsc is not used in any Bytes code base. This race is triggered by some
# rust runtime logic.
race:std*mpsc_queue

# Probably more fences in std.
race:__call_tls_dtors

# `is_inline` is explicitly called concurrently without synchronization. The
# safety explanation can be found in a comment.
